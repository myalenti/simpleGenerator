# simpleGenerator

This dataset and workload generator is not document.
It is simple to use but it requires manipulating environment variable.
There are essentially two modes. insert and workload.
You toggle between both modes by editing the opMode variable
there are other elements to change in the env vars - they are self explanatory but in due time i will document them.
